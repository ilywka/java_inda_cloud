Now i have high level understanding of microservice architecture(what is it, when to use or not).
Also i've learned some commonly used infrastructure patterns for implementing communications, transactions, decomposition and etc.
As a plus now i know some spring implementations of learned patterns, and got familiar with spring-cloud project(never met it before).
